# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

For now its just called DreamScape High

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My final project will be about a teenage boy starting his freshman year at new highschool and new state. In the visual novel, you will be able to talk to new students, make friends, and even answer questions that will be asked by teachers. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will definitely finish the character sprites because I already draw a lot to begin with so I'll be finished with those in no time. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO i can learn how to use Renpy in time

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO I can do the script for my project in time 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO My next steps is to learn how to use RenPy so i can upload my sprites and start working on the scripts. Some new skills would be having RenPy under my belt. I won't really need to research anything except Pintrest only for refrences for background or characters.
